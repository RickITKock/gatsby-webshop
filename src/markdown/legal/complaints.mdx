We want you to feel like every item is the perfect match for your work environment. If it’s not the right fit, we’ll help you get it sorted and have it on your way. You can return most items for a refund or store credit within 30 days of delivery. Return shipping costs apply, and the item must be in its original condition and packaging to be accepted.

&nbsp;

We recommend that you first report complaints to us by emailing **info@werkcomfortabel.eu**. If this does not lead to a solution, it is possible to register your dispute via Stichting WebwinkelKeur. From February 15, 2016 it is also possible for consumers in the EU to register complaints via the ODR platform of the European Commission. This ODR platform can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/odr. If your complaint is not yet being dealt with elsewhere, you are free to deposit your complaint via the European Union platform.
