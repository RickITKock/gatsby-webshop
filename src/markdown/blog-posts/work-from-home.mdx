Currently, you’re working through a pandemic and that carries with it the possibility of working from home. However, perhaps you feel you are not getting enough done or you simply need a productivity boost. You know that you can do more and get more done! Let’s explore a few ways to increase your productivity (which you may not have considered).

&nbsp;

## Create a routine

What activities put you in the **right frame of mind** to work productively? I personally like to wake up at 6 am and start my day by working out for thirty minutes. Afterwards, I’ll meditate for 10-20 minutes. Then, I like to take a cold shower and have breakfast, etc.

&nbsp;

Automate your routine by using your digital calendar and set notifications.

&nbsp;

## Create a schedule

Remote work means holding yourself accountable. The benefit of working from home, is that you can create a flexible schedule: it is well-advised to also schedule nonwork activities. Scheduling and planning activities may seem unnecessary but remember that planning really is thinking in advance. Thus, when you think in advance, you can limit the amount of time you could waste on a certain task.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, scheduling increases likelihood that you won’t forget to do them, ergo you’ll make less mistakes. Finally, don’t forget to schedule breaks.

&nbsp;

## Distractions

One of the biggest challenges of working from home is distractions: emails, cell phones, household duties… and so on. We suggest keeping your brain in the right mode by avoiding doing nonwork tasks during your work time. You may, for instance, schedule a separate time to do laundry instead of tackling it while you’re finishing a work presentation.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, there are many simple ways you could make it clear to others about your working hours.

## Your office chair

Do you already own a high-quality ergonomic office chair? Such a piece of furniture may be pricy, but (and although this may sound like a cliche), it is an investment in your health. Have you ever thought of the fact that by opting for a cheap office chair could lead to health problems which could lead to a decrease in productivity? Are you really saving money by purchasing cheap furniture? Such decisions are challenging, but it is well-advised to opt for a high-quality ergonomic chair.

## Conclusion

As your work environment changes, you may need to make a couple of adjustments to your work-related activities. Take these above few tips and tricks into consideration and learn to adapt to your new work environment.
